<body>
<h1>WARNING WARNING WARNING!</h1>
<h2>Instructions from Fall 2023 are subject to change in Spring 2024</h2>
<p>I'm sharing this based on student feedback, there may be changes before the work is available in canvas. </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="#step1">Step 1 Week 9</a></li>
    <li><a href="#step2">Step 2 Week 10</a></li>

</ul>

<h2 id="step1">Decision App - Step 1 - Week 9</h2>

<p>Topics covered:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Setup a new folder my-app in our private repo and inside there create the normal files files (index.html, main.js and a README.md)</li>
    <li>In you README.md file write the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Name of App</li>
            <li>Description of purpose</li>
            <li>Variables:
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Least 3 global variables - at least 1 of the following: string, number and boolean</span></li>
                    <li><span>Use const and let were appropriate</span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span>Decision Making Process</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>Write in your understanding (not in code) how your app will make your selected decision.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><span>Make sure you have at least 1 type calculation. </span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><span>Output</span>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>This will output (console.log is fine for now) the decision based on the inputs and conditional logic above. </span></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Now write<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="inline_disabled external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>condition</span><span class="external_link_icon" role="presentation"><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>and<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="inline_disabled external" title="Link" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span>comparsion operators</span><span class="external_link_icon" role="presentation"><span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>that will reflect the result of your decision making process based on the inputs (variables provided).<br />
        <ul>
            <li>You need to implement at least 2 condition blocks and use at&nbsp; &amp;&amp; or ||&nbsp; in your code.</li>
            <li>Make sure you document your code using comments.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Don't write functions (yet) show your decision output on the page or use console.log.</li>
    <li>Reach out for help (tutor, my office hour or discord) and ask for help if needed.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>COMMIT MESSAGE - "my app step 1"</li>
    <li>Provide your commit history for this (my-app) folder.&nbsp;</li>
    <li>What I will look for in your work is the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Did you include all the written section described above.</li>
            <li>Did you code meet the requirements</li>
            <li>Did you code work and create the described output</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>THIS may be included in the code review that is required for this class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<h2 id="step2">Decision App - Step 2 - Week 10</h2>
<p><strong>Here is what you need to do for this week in your my-app folder in your private folder</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>MAKE SURE YOU FIX any issues you had for Step 1!&nbsp; Please reach out if you need help!&nbsp;</strong></li>
    <li>Create a new folder inside your my-app folder named step1 and copy the code from the root (my-app) into step1, then create another new folder name step2 and copy the code from step1 into step2. Here is what the end structure will be:<br /><img id="21603416" src="https://scccd.instructure.com/courses/107618/files/22224001/preview" alt="folders.png" data-api-endpoint="https://scccd.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/107618/files/22224001" data-api-returntype="File" /></li>
    <li>Implement at least 2 named functions
        <ul>
            <li>Using const to declare the functions</li>
            <li>You can either write traditional functions or arrow functions</li>
            <li>The global variables you created in step1 will become arguments passed into the functions as parameters.
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to decrease the number of global variables.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The functions need to work together, what this mean is that one function needs to have return values that you will use in another function:
                <ul>
                    <li>Create a data structure with both input and decision values.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>You can select which data structure you want to use this week. For example you can use a string, array, object or an array of objects.</li>
                    <li>Next week we will update to use and array of objects, but here you can choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Make sure you call your function(s) several times with different inputs and display the decision on the page (index.html).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Submit your commit history for the step2 folder.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step3">Decision App - Step 2 - Week 11</h2>
<p>Here is what you need to do for this week:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Array of Objects</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Fix any issues you had for Step 2 and then create a new folder step3 and copy your ending copy from step2.</li>
            <li>For this week you need to update your code to store the inputs and the calculated data into an array of objects.&nbsp;
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure you are calling your function several times and loop over the resulting array of object to show the obj (console or on the page).&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Start Form&nbsp;</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Create your form this week, you should have a min of 2 inputs, validate with html or write custom validation.</li>
            <li>Write an eventlisteners to show the input data on the console or on the page.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>For this week you don't need to connect the form to your functions, but you can.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JNalR0Iv_o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JNalR0Iv_o</a></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>This code may be included in your code review.&nbsp;</li>
